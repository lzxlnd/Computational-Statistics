## Using Monte Carlo method to do Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

```{r}

#package set-up

library(ggplot2)


```


Write a function to calculate K-S statistics(D) first.

```{r Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics}

##calculate D

D<-function(x,y){       #x: observations, y: distribution
  n<-length(x)
  m<-length(y)
  f<-replicate(n,0)
  
  sx<-sort(x)
  sy<-sort(y)
  
  for (i in 1:n) {
    f[i]<-abs(as.numeric( i/n-rank(c(sx[i],sy))[1]/(m+1))) #calculate difference of p
    
    ##the following may be wrong for it calculate the difference of quantile
    #f[i]<-abs(as.numeric(quantile(x,probs = (i-1)/(n-1))-quantile(y,probs = (i-1)/(n-1))))
  }
  max(f)
}

```


The following is a function to do K-S test, using Monte Carlo method.

```{r K-S test}
##KS-TEST

MC.KS<-function(x,y,times,size=100,probs =.05,plot=FALSE){       
  #y is a vector, size: sample size, times: sample times
  dis<-replicate(times,D(sample(y,size,replace = TRUE),y)) 
  # sample to generate distribution of D
  
  p.val<-length(dis[dis>=D(x,y)])/times 
  #calculate p-value using estimate distribution
  
  cat(c("D=",D(x,y),"\n"))   #print outcome
  if(p.val>=probs){
    cat("they are from the same distribution.\n")
    cat(t(data.frame(c("p-value =",p.val,"\n"))))
  }
  else{
    cat("they are NOT from the same distribution.\n")
    cat(t(data.frame("p-value =",p.val,"\n")))
  }
  if(plot){
    ggplot(data.frame(dis),aes(x=dis))+geom_histogram(bins = 20)
  }
}

```

##Do K-S test on real data

```{r K-S test in real data}
